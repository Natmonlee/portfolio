My online portfolio

This portfolio was made by editing a bootstrap template (https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer)

There was an unexpected challenge in this project as the github pages site was unable to fetch from my API due to it not sending a response through HTTPS. I decided to work around the issue by adding a GET endpoint to my API that sends the documentation website as a response. I was then able to link my documentation site to my portfolio using the endpoint - rather than hosting the documentation site on github pages.
